# SchoolManager
An Andriod application written in Java (Android Studio).
Provides tests from given pictures or words all ordered in custom hierarchy with adaptable options.
The current goal is to make it work on android, there is also going to be a computer version in JavaFX (NetBeans IDE).
All hierarchy files are platform independant with an interface, which takes care of opening files on different systems and also adds default fail handlers used by the database system.
