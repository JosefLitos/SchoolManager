# SchoolManager
Andriod application written in Java. Provides tests from given pictures or words all ordered in custom hierarchy with many options.
The current goal is to make it work on android (SchlMgr folder),
the other folder (SchoolManager) is going to be the computer version (in JavaFX)
All hierarchy files are platform independant except Formatter.java, which takes care of opening files on different systems
and also adds default fail handlers used by the database system.
